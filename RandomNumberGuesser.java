/*
 * Class: CMSC203 
 * Instructor: Ms.Monshi
 * Description: This class will allow the user to play a guessing game with the RNG class. The user will be asked to input a number
 * then the response given will be information to deduce what the random number is. 
 * Due: 2/23/2021
 * Platform/compiler: Eclipse
 * I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment independently.
   I have not copied the code from a student or any source.
   I have not given my code to any student.
   Print your Name here: Kevin Gomes
